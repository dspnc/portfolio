            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Spencer's the name, and web development is the game! With previous work experience at multiple enterprise e-commerce software providers, I have seen how the 'full stack' of software, employees on different teams, and clients can work together efficiently in order to drive sales and support complex systems. After working first as a software support technician and then in account management, I decided to enroll in a full stack webdev bootcamp at my alma mater to move over to the development side, as I have always seen myself as a writer with the desire to create and have a passion for using tech to make life easier.</p>
            <p>I originally earned my bachelor's degree in Journalism at UNC with a focus on Advertising/PR. Outside the office, I am passionate about the outdoors, having also served for AmeriCorps for a few years after college in the mountains of Pennsylvania for an outdoor youth mentorship program that instilled in me a great appreciation for serving others. During those years, I also realized just how much insight that can be learned and shared by a campfire under the stars when people's pretenses fade away and it's just fellow man and the wild. Hobbies include snowboarding, random roadtrips, camping, and Rocket League.</p>

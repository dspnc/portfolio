# portfolio

## This project serves as a portfolio for David Spencer Hill

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation for this project is to begin building up a real portfolio of deployed applications that I can use to get a job in web development upon completion of this course.

- Why did you build this project? 
This project showcases the specific applications that I have/will be building and will serve as a work-in-progress going forward as I continue to learn new webdev skills

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of not having any portfolio of my own or real projects to showcase. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML/CSS so far and set myself up for improving my portfolio in the future.

- What did you learn?
I learned that flexbox is a tricky beast and sometimes seems to act in peculiar ways, as in, sometimes things that should get centered do not seem to get centered, but there is always a reason once you trace back through the steps taken and figure out how different CSS selectors might be affecting each other. The box model is very important to remember.
